# Purpose: This project's goal is to create a website for the Tennille Methodist Church (TMC) for the Project 2 requirement of our Internet Programming class. The site will use nodeJs, Angular.js, MongoDB, as well as HTML, CSS, and JS to create a dynamic website that resonds to user input. Users can register for an account and login with that account. While logged in the user has access to pages that a non-logged in user would not and have the ability to alter data on those pages. Information is stored in collections within the MongoDB and users can insert, update, and delete documents within the database.
